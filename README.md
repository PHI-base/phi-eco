# PHI-ECO

PHI-ECO (**PHI**-base **E**xperimental **C**onditions **O**ntology) is an ontology that describes chemical treatments, growing conditions, study types, and experimental environments.

PHI-ECO is an application-focused ontology developed for use in [PHI-base](http://www.phi-base.org/) (the Pathogen-Host Interactions Database) and its version of [Canto](https://github.com/pombase/canto), a community curation tool. PHI-ECO is derived from [PECO](https://github.com/pombase/fypo/blob/master/peco.obo), the Pombe Experimental Conditions Ontology, and should not be confused with the [Plant Experimental Conditions Ontology](http://www.obofoundry.org/ontology/peco.html).
